Problem formulation:
- Output an action (buy/sell/nothing), then check if the action was good.
	- Action choice
		- Forecast next timestep and buy/sell accordingly
		- External source of data
	- Performance measure
		- Profit/loss for that single timestep
		- Average balance over n timesteps
		- Sharpe ratio: (Rp - Rf) / Op

Data format:
- Rolling window

Model exploration (forecasting)
- MLP, LSTM, decision trees (sklearn)
- holt-winters
- lstm autoencoder
- pca variants

Model formulation
- Negative profit as training loss

Online learning algorithms
- DQN, rainbow DQN
- PPO, TRPO, HRL

Insights:
- LSTM Forecasting doesn't work well, suspect most ML won't work.
- Back to time series analysis: ARIMA, Exponentially weighted moving average
